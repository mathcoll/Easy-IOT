# t6 - Connect real world Object to Digital Api
t6 is an "oriented-Data" platform to connect physical Objects with timeseries DB.
Please referes to CONTRIBUTING.md in case you would like to help :-)

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3d45972dd53246f58ba82a6f75483116)](https://www.codacy.com/app/internetcollaboratif/t6?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=mathcoll/t6&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## Physical World
Physical World are composed by your sensors and actuators, real physical Objects.
In t6, physical Objects require a virtual _Object_ as a reference in t6 and then, they are able to add _Data_ to _Flows_.

Sample nodeMCU and Arduino scripts are available in the _[sensors](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6/tree/master/sensors)_ repositories and on [t6iot Arduino library](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6iot).

## t6 API first: Live, eat, and breathe the API-first lifestyle of t6
Detailed Api documentation is available here: [api-General](https://api.internetcollaboratif.info/docs/).

To install t6, follow the guide on [Wiki page](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6/wiki)

## t6 Android Application
_t6_ is available on the [Android Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.internetcollaboratif.api) for free.
This Aplpication is using exactly the same code and Api from this repository.
